  title: On proper splinters in positive characteristic
  speaker: krah
  abstract: >
    <p>A scheme $X$ is a splinter if for any finite surjective morphism $f\colon Y \to X$ the pullback map $\mathcal{O}_X \to f_* \mathcal{O}_Y$ splits as $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules. By the direct summand conjecture, now a theorem due to André, every regular Noetherian ring is a splinter. Whilst for affine schemes the splinter property can be viewed as a local measure of singularity, the splinter property imposes strong constraints on the global geometry of proper schemes over a field of positive characteristic. For instance, the structure sheaf of a proper splinter in positive characteristic has vanishing positive-degree cohomology. I will report on joint work with Charles Vial concerning further obstructions on the global geometry of proper splinters in positive characteristic. Further, I will address the derived-invariance of the (derived-)splinter property.

    <p>Kronecker moduli are algebraic varieties parametrizing linear algebra data up to base change. We consider generating series of their motives, and discuss results characterizing these series by functional and differential equations.

  title: The motive of the Hilbert scheme of points in all dimensions
  speaker: ricolfi
  abstract: >
    <p>The geometry of Hilbert schemes of points is largely unknown, or known to be pathological in a precise sense. This should in principle make most Hilbert scheme invariants essentially inaccessible. We present a closed formula for the generating function of the motives (classes in the Grothendieck ring of varieties) of Hilbert schemes of points $\mathrm{Hilb}(\mathbb{C}^n,d)$, varying the ambient dimension $n$ and having fixed the number of points $d$. Joint work with M. Graffeo, S. Monavari and R. Moschetti.
